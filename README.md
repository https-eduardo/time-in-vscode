# ðŸ‘¾ Time In VSCode

Just a simple extension that registers time elapsed in the VSCode and in a workspace. When installed, it will auto initialize when VSCode opens. You can see the information by clicking at the button in the bottom status bar. If there's no file opened the time will not be counted.
